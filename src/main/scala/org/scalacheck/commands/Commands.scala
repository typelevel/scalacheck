   *  instances might still receive commands in parallel, if the

   *
   *  When setting `threadCount` larger than one, ScalaCheck must evaluate
   *  all possible command interleavings (and the end [[State]] instances
   *  they produce), since parallel command execution is non-deterministic.
   *  ScalaCheck tries out all possible end states with the
   *  [[Command.postCondition]] function of the very last command executed
   *  (there is always exactly one command executed after all parallel command
   *  executions). If it fails to find an end state that satisfies the
   *  postcondition, the test fails.
   *  However, the number of possible end states grows rapidly with increasing
   *  values of `threadCount`. Therefore, the lengths of the parallel command
   *  sequences are limited so that the number of possible end states don't
   *  exceed `maxParComb`. The default value of `maxParComb` is 1000000. */
