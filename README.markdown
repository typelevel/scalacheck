[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/typelevel/scalacheck.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/typelevel/scalacheck)

ScalaCheck is a library written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and
used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs.
ScalaCheck was originally inspired by the Haskell library
[QuickCheck](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), but has also
ventured into its own.

ScalaCheck has no external dependencies other than the Scala runtime, and
[works](http://www.scalacheck.org/download.html#sbt) great with [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), the
Scala build tool. It is also fully integrated in the test frameworks
[ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and
[specs2](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/). You can of course also use
ScalaCheck completely standalone, with its built-in test runner.

ScalaCheck is used by several prominent Scala projects, for example the [Scala
compiler](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and the [Akka](http://akka.io/)
concurrency framework.
